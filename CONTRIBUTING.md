### Tests

At the moment tests are minimal, most pages of this site are only tested for
access-rights. Contributions is therefore very much welcome.

### Database changes

If you want to change the database use follow the instruction for `alembic`. Make
sure to adjust the definitions in `muesli/models.py`.
To upgrade to the latest version of the database:
```bash
$ alemic upgrade head
```
To create new revisions use:
```bash
$ alembic revision -m "Added a column"
```

### Static web-content

Don't add JS-libraries to the repository, instead add add them to the package.json file and let them be copied by the
Dockerfile. You can install new dependencies with `apt` via the `Dockerfile`, too.

### Page setup

To create or edit a page you can edit the template to change the visuals, to add
functions you edit the `views*.py` file. In the `.py` you can pass variables
to the template and write server-side logic.
You can also execute arbitrary python statements in the templates,
so dont underestimate their power.
Remember to add tests for all new pages!

For each class or function belonging to a page you need a decorator like this
one:

```python
@view_config(
    route_name='admin',
    renderer='muesli.web:templates/admin.pt',
    context=GeneralContext,
    permission='admin'
)
```

You set a name matching the name given in `__init__.py`, the renderer is used
to set the corresponding template file. The context is important to control the
permissions and influences what is shown in the navigation. The permission
attribute is used to set the permission.

### Permissions

The permissions are granted in the `context.py` file using the `__acl__` attribute.
When changing permissions update them in `muesli/web/navigation_tree.py` and the API as
necessary. Keep in mind that the API uses its own contexts and update them accordingly.

This means you cannot get the permission of a page dynamically and if you want
to check for a permission you have to make sure the permission is granted in the
specific context.

### Navigation\_tree

The navigation_tree is a tree-structure saved in the request object used for the
navigation buttons at the top. When editing this tree make sure not to create
any cycles, since these will crash the template-engine.

### The API

#### How it works

For every API endpoint there is a file in `./muesli/web/api/v1/`.
This file contains a class which represents the resource and behavior for the API.
To ensure the class recognized by `cornice` it has the following decorator:

```python
@resource(collection_path='/lectures',
          path='/lectures/{lecture_id}',
          factory=context.LectureEndpointContext)
class Lecture:
    def __init__(self, request, context=None):
    [...]
```

The classes are then added to the pyramid views in `./muesli/web/__init__.py`:
```python
def main(global_config=None, testmode=False, **settings):
    [...]
    config.include('cornice')
    [...]
```

#### Expanding the API

If you want to add another endpoint, have a look at the code in
[`./muesli/web/api/v1/helloEndpoint.py`](./muesli/web/api/v1/helloEndpoint.py)
as it is a very simple endpoint to experiment with it.

Add a method for `POST` or something else to get familiar with how things work.

It can also make sense to change the following value in `./muesli.yml.example` 
since it provides some tooling to analyze the framework.
```yaml
development: False
```
